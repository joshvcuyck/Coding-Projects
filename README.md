All of the projects I do for fun in one place. My portfolio :)

Simulation of Natural Selection:

This was my 11th grade school project. I did using the processing library and java. There is a UI and the simulation. You can make your own player which you can watch reproduce and dominate the simulation too. Enjoy!
